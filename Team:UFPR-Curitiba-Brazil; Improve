<h1>Improve a Previous Part or Previous Project</h1>
<p>For teams seeking to improve upon a previous part or project, you should document all of your work on this page. Please remember to include all part measurement and characterization data on the part's main page on the Registry. Please include a link to your improved part's Registry page on this page.</p>

<h3>Gold Medal Criterion #2</h3>
<p><b>Improve a Previous Part - Standard Tracks:</b> Convince the judges that you have created a new BioBrick Part that has a functional improvement upon an existing BioBrick Part. You must perform experiments with both parts to demonstrate this improvement. Clearly document the quantitative experimental characterization data on the Part's Main Page on the Registry for both the existing and new parts (see the <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Help:Document_Parts">Registry Document Parts page</a> for instructions). 
<br><br>
Both the existing and new part must be <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Help:Standards/Assembly/RFC10">RFC10</a> or Type IIS compatible. The sequences of the new and existing parts must be different. The existing part must NOT be from your 2019 part number range and must be different from the part you used in Bronze #4. The new part you create must also be different from the new part documented in Silver #1. Please see the <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Measurement/Resources">Measurement Resources page</a> for more information about experimental characterization data. 
<br><br>
<b>Improve a Previous Project - Special Tracks:</b> Improve the function of an existing iGEM project (that your current team did not originally create) and display your achievement on your wiki.</p>
