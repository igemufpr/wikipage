<h3>Gold Medal Criterion #4</h3>

<p>
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your engineered system works. 
<br><br>
Your engineered system has to work under realistic conditions. Your system must comply with all <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Safety/Rules">rules</a> and <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Safety/Policies">policies</a> approved by the iGEM Safety Committee. Your system can derive from or make functional a previous iGEM project by your team or by another team. For multi-component projects, the judges may consider the function of individual components.

</p>

<p>
To be eligible for this award, you must add clear documentation to this page and delete the alert box at the top of this page.
